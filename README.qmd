# kaplan-meier-function

This is the code and configuration for `kaplan-meier-function`, an R reusable action for the OpenSAFELY framework.

This action uses the Kaplan-Meier estimator to calculate the cumulative incidence of an event over time, from a given origin date, possibly stratified by an exposure variable and/or a subgroup variable. Event times may be censored. 

There is EXPERIMENTAL support for statistical disclosure control in the action, with further assurance tests and methodological explanations pending. 
We recommend comparing rounded KM estimates to the unrounded KM estimates (prior to release) to ensure that the rounded estimates are a sensible approximation. 

Additional arguments provide control over smoothing, maximum follow-up duration, plotting, and other options -- a full list of available arguments is given below.


## Usage

This action should be specified in the `project.yaml` file of your OpenSAFELY study repository, where you should replace `[version]`
with [the latest tag](https://github.com/opensafely-actions/kaplan-meier-function/tags),
e.g., `v0.0.1`. Note that no space is allowed between `kaplan-meier-function:` and `[version]`.


The arguments to the action are specified using the flags style, i.e., `--argname=argvalue`. The available arguments to this action are as follows:

```{r, echo=FALSE, comment = '', linewidth=80}
source_lines <- function(file, lines) {
    source(textConnection(readLines(file)[lines]))
}
# Note: in the following command the last line should be the line that
# creates the opt_parser object using OptionParser(...)
source_lines("analysis/km.R", 46:96)
optparse::print_help(opt_parser)
```

For example, the relevant action in the `project.yaml` file might look something like this:

```yaml

my_kaplan_meier_function_action:
  run: kaplan-meier-function:v0.0.1
    --df_input=cohort.csv
    --df_output=output/km_estimates.csv
    ...# more arguments here
  outputs:
    highly_sensitive:
      output: output/km_estimates/.*feather

...
```

For a more complete example of the arguments this action uses, see [this repo's `project.yaml` file](./project.yaml).

The main script for this action is [`analyis/km.R`](./analysis/km.R).
