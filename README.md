# kaplan-meier-function

This is the code and configuration for `kaplan-meier-function`, an R reusable action for the OpenSAFELY framework.

Given a dataset containing start dates, event dates, censoring dates, treatment groups, the action returns Kaplan-Meier estimates for these characteristics. Additional arguments provide control over estiamtion withn sub-groups, the level of rounding, smoothing, maximum follow-up duration, and other elements.

Further details about this reusable action to follow.


## Usage

The arguments/options to the action are specified using the flags style
(i.e., `--argname=argvalue`), the arguments and how to use them can be
viewed in the [`km.R`](./analysis/km.R) script.

This action can be specified in the `project.yaml` with its options at
their default values as follows, where you should replace `[version]`
with the latest tag from
[here](https://github.com/opensafely-actions/kaplan-meier-function/tags),
e.g., `v0.0.1`. Note that no space is allowed between
`kaplan-meier-function:` and `[version]`.

``` yaml

my_kaplan_meier_function_action:
  run: kaplan-meier-function:v0.0.1
    --df_input=cohort.csv
    --df_output=output/km_estimates.csv
    ...
  outputs:
    highly_sensitive:
      output: output/km_estimates.csv

```
